# tensorflow_selfstudy

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. 
It is a symbolic math library, and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

Here I am learnig the tensorflow to build the CNN, RNN for big data analysis. 

Code will be updated once I learned.
